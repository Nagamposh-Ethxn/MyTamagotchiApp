The purpose of my app is to mimic a virtual pet. The app allows you to engage with the pet, allowing you to feed it, play with it and clean it. 
The app may be used for educational purposes by toddlers , even adults as well who want to see how the app functions.
The design of my app was kept really simple to ensure that whole whom are engaing with it can nagivate through the app easily without having any issues.
The app consists of 2 screen, screen 1 is where ou will be welcomed and screen 2 is where you can engage with the app.
For submission , I ahd used GitHub to submit my code, theprocess was not complicated, but there were alot of steps involved.
Using GitHub allowed me to create, store, change, merge and collaborate with my code
Now that I have submitted my code through GitHub my lecturer can view it, make edits or changes.
GitHub assisted me in hosting my code for version control and collaboration. 
Using GitHub to submit my code made it easy for me, the developer to push it through for the end user to view it.
My overall experiance with GitHub was good and has definitely improved since my last submission.
